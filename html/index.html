<h1 id="idea">Our idea</h1>

<h2> Why are we creating the website? </h2>
<p> We lived in a patriotic society for centuries, where the man's role was to
    provide for the family, while the woman's cared for the house and the
    children. However during the years of development and modernization of society,
    there have been several new opportunities and changes. Many women now have
    access to education and the opportunity to participate in working life.
    Still, there are women in different parts of the world who do not have
    the same opportunities. They are not given the opportunity to participate
    in working life or develop further. </p>

<h2> Who can use this website </h2>
<p> This idea focuses on women who have good business ideas, but who do not have
    enough resources to complete or further develop it. Our goal is to connect
    these women with investors from around the world. This will give
    underprivileged women a good opportunity to run their own business and be
    independent. </p>


<h2> Impact of the idea on the future </h2>
<p> This solution will not only be useful for the ideator, but also for the
    local community and society. For example, they will be able to inspire other
    women to be independent and go in the same direction. further, if their idea
    were to get an investor and be put into practice, it would create more jobs,
    which in turn would improve the country's infrastructure. </p>

<h1 id="design">Website design</h1>
<!-- The source used to create the prototypes: https://marvelapp.com/!-->
<p> We have designed some prototypes regarding the website, so the idea of our
    project is clear and more understandable. This will help the users and
    potential future investors to get a better understanding and make it easier
    to invest in the project. We have focused on user experience, by making the
    website clear and simple to use. Since we want the website to be accesiable
    globally, we have decided to avoid using complicatet languages, and instead
    added more icons. At the same time, we have decided to not use
    bizzare colours so that the website looks more professional and business
    orientated. This way the users and investors phatos will increase. </p>


<h2>The Homepage</h2>

<p>
This is the prototype of how the frontpage will look like. Here you can access
information about the project, creators and view photos of their work. On the
right-top there is a "log in" button. It is for both investors and ideators to
create a user and fullfil their reason of visit. Even though it is aimed
for investors and ideators, we are not expecting them to be the only users of
the page. Therefore we have included "about us" so the users can get to know the
developers and their purpose behind it.
</p>

<h2>Search engine</h2>

      look for investors" class="responsive">
</picture>
<p>
After logging in, this is what the page will look like for the investors.
Here they will be able to look after ideas and support the ladies. They can
either search for a specific idea or choose from the categories listed. We have
added a location category. With this it will be easier them to find ideas from
their preferable geographical location. It will also help them to narrow down
the options available.
</p>

<h2>Presentation of the Ideas</h2>
<picture>

<p>
On the picture above, you can see an example of how the ideas are presented.
In the left-hand side is a picture added by the ideator with a short description
of the idea on the right. If the investors are interested, they can book an
appointment with the ideator. We have decided to not showcase name and picture
of the ideators. It is to prevent investors choosing people over ideas.
The investor will only get contact information after booking a meeting.

  <h1 id="about">About us!</h1>
  <p>Hi!<br>
     We are two students from Oslo Metropolitan University who are pursuing
     bachelor’s in computer engineering. We were asked to be innovative and
     come up with some possible solutions to achieve UN’s sustainable
     development goal nr.5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and
     girls” in one of our former assignment.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of our ideas was; “Many females have great business ideas but are
    left unheard. They could be linked up with investors online through a
    webpage where they can approach their ideas.”. This webpage is supposed
    to give you an insight on how we plan to fease our solution. You can
    contact us on our e-mail: blablabla@gmail.com
