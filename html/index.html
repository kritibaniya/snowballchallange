<h1>Our idea</h1>

<h2> Why are we creating the website? </h2>
<p> We lived in a patriotic society for centuries, where the man's role was to
    provide for the family, while the woman's cared for the house and the
    children.But during the years of development and modernization of society,
    there have been several new opportunities and changes. Many women now have
    access to education and the opportunity to participate in working life.
    Still, there are more women in different parts of the world who do not have
    the same opportunities. They are not given the opportunity to participate
    in working life or develop further. </p>

<h2> Who can use this website. </h2>
<p> This idea focuses on women who have good business ideas, but who do not have
    enough resources to complete or further develop it. Our goal is to connect
    these women with investors from around the world. This will give
    underprivileged women a good opportunity to run their own business and be
    independent. </p>


<h2> Impact of the idea on the future: </h2>
<p> This solution will not only be useful for the ideator, but also for the
    local community and society. For example, they will be able to inspire other
    women to be independent and go in the same direction. further, if their idea
    were to get an investor and be put into practice, it would create more jobs,
    which in turn would improve the country's infrastructure. </p>

<h2>The Homepage</h2>

This is the prototype of how the frontpage will look like. Here you can access
information about the project, creators and view photos of their work. On the
right-top there is a log in button. It is for both investors and ideators to
create a user and fullfil their reason of visit. (momina)

<h2>Search engine</h2>

      look for investors" class="responsive">

<p>
After logging in, this is what the page will look like for the investors.
Here they will be able to look after ideas and support the ladies. They can
either search for a specific idea or choose from the categories listed. We have
added a location category. With this it will be easier them to find ideas from
their preferable geographical location. It will also help them to narrow down
the options available.
</p>

<h2>Presentation of the Ideas</h2>

<p>
On the picture above, you can see an example of how the ideas are presented.
In the left-hand side is a picture added by the ideator with a short description
of the idea on the right. If the investors are interested, they can book an
appointment with the ideator. We have decided to not showcase name and picture
of the ideators. It is to prevent investors choosing people over ideas.
The investor will only get contact information after booking a meeting.

  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>Hi!<br>
     We are two students from Oslo Metropolitan University who are pursuing
     bachelor’s in computer engineering. We were asked to be innovative and
     come up with some possible solutions to achieve UN’s sustainable
     development goal nr.5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and
     girls” in one of our former assignment.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of our ideas was to “Many females have great business ideas but are
    left unheard. They could be linked up with investors online through a
    webpage where they can approach their ideas.”. This webpage is supposed
    to give you an insight on how we plan to fease our solution. You can
    contact us on our e-mail: blablabla@gmail.com
